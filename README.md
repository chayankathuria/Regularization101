# Regularization101
Understanding Regularization by visualizations

I will be creating a dummy non-linear data set and fit linear and polynomial regressions to the data and see when does it starts to over fit.

I will make a pipeline and iterate through all the algorithms and check which one has the best MSE and R2 scores.

I then aim to apply L1 and L2 regressions on the same data and polynomial features and see the results.

Regularization should decrease overfitting to a large amount for even highly overfitting polynomial regressions of very high orders.

Used Cross validation for evaluating the models. Will also be checking using TrainTestSplit.
