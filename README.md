# Regularization101
Understanding Regularization by visualizations

I will be creating a dummy non-linear data set and fit linear and polynomial regressions to the data and see when does it starts to over fit.

I will make a pipeline and iterate through all the algorithms and check which one has the best MSE and R2 scores.

I then aim to apply L1 and L2 regressions on the same data and polynomial features and see the results.

Regularization should decrease overfitting to a large amount for even highly overfitting polynomial regressions of very high orders.

..
Used Cross validation for evaluating the models. Will also be checking using TrainTestSplit.

..
Check the performance of polynomial models upto 20 order on the non linear data

Plotted the predictions and checked for overfitting of higher order models

Plotted same models using ridge and Lasso to see the 'smoothening' effect
